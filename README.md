# SPDX Cryptographic Algorithm List README

This repository contains the **SPDX Cryptographic Algorithms List**, a standardized, community-curated list of cryptographic algorithms.

Modeled after the [SPDX License List](https://spdx.org/licenses/), this list provides a shared and unambiguous vocabulary for identifying and referencing cryptographic algorithms in Software Bills of Materials (SBOM), SPDX documents, and related tooling.

The repository currently contains:
* A folder containing YAML files, each representing an individual cryptographic algorithm with its associated properties.
* A Markdown document titled “*SPDX Cryptographic Algorithms List Properties Description*”, which defines and explains the properties used in the YAML files.

## SPDX Cryptography Group

The SPDX Cryptographic Algorithms List is developed and maintained by the SPDX Cryptography Group, which supports the broader [SPDX Project](https://spdx.dev/about/overview/) by:
* Aligning the list’s format and structure with current and future SPDX specifications.
* Fostering collaboration and interoperability with standards bodies and open source communities.
* Promoting the adoption of the list and its identifiers across the software ecosystem.
